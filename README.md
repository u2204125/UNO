# UNO

A world-wide played one of the popular indoor card games in the history. In this repo, I have tried to build a command-line based UNO game. Although there are plenty of them out there with more facinating UI and overwhelmed with features, I just developed it to have some fun and spend some time. Hope you enjoy it!! 

And don't forget to fork this repo if you want more from this as something massive might be comming soon!!

So stay tuned! Don't have a good day, have a great day!!!

## Features

- Upto 10 players can play at a time.

- Name can be assigned to each player or can be blank (in that case a default name will be set).

- Simple yet neat styling.

- Clears the console after one's turn so that another player can not see others deck.

- Automitically detects UNO call moment.

- More than 3 invalid inputs will make the game terminate.

- Developed with proper message(error/alert/info) displaying.

- Asks for confirmation before exiting the game.

## Installation

One needs to have all the prerequities installed on the local machine to run a C# project (you can check [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VodLDVAy3QQ) out). Then clone my repo and you are good to go.
